These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example, a setting of 1/60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually, a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene, for motion shots, while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused, abstract result.", "dorota-id": "cammarkt.com//11"}, {"<page title>": "Canon EOS Rebel D700 T5I 18 0 MP Digital SLR Camera Black Body New 013803222425 | eBay", "brand": "Canon", "condition": "New: A brand-new, unused, unopened, undamaged item in its original packaging (where packaging is\napplicable).

These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example, a setting of 1/60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually, a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene, for motion shots, while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused, abstract result.", "width": ["5.2 in.", "13.2 cm\nA viewfinder is the small square on the back of a camera that you look through to compose the scene.

For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity.

The 24mm ultra Wide-Angle allows you to create shots with dramatic perspective and makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings. This superb lens delivers outstanding optical performance throughout its zoom range. It's advanced design employs UD glass, double-sided aspherical glass-molded and ultra-high-refraction-index glass lens elements to effectively suppress chromatic aberration while maintaining a remarkably compact size.

By incorporating a UD (Ultra Low Dispersion) lens into the lens element, the chromatic aberration has been reduced. This model incorporates an image stabilizer, which reduces the effects of camera shake while shooting. In addition, the zoom lens's super-smooth, super-fast ultra sonic motor (USM) provides all the zooming speed you need.This camera can take VGA (640 x 480 pixels) movies with exceptional image quality at a full 30 frames per second. Furthermore, it can shoot movies even in the still image shooting modes and vice versa. Also, a new mode to take very smooth QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) movies at 60 frames per second has been newly added. Moreover, digital zoom and manual focus are available as well as adjusting the zoom or exposure, or locking the AF or exposure while shooting a movie. Movies can be taken continuously (depending on the storage capacity of the recording media) until the clip size reaches 1GB or the clip length reaches 1 hour.The recording pixels include a \"Widescreen\" feature that has the same aspect ratio as 16:9 widescreen TVs for shooting wide images. Adding ISO [800] has resulted in a faster shutter speed even when shooting in dark environments. Also, [High ISO Auto] that has a program diagram with a higher ISO speed setting has been added to the ISO speed position.Featuring \"Sports\" as a shooting mode has resulted in better focusing of moving subjects, which is especially useful when shooting sporting events. A \"My Colors\" mode that changes image colors when shooting has been added to the FUNC.

Also, this camera shows the possible shooting range within which auto-focusing at the current zoom position.As the recording quality is set up to 16 bit, 44.100 k Hz with the stereo microphone, high quality recording is possible when shooting movies. In addition, \"Sound Recorder\" can record sound only, without images.Using My Colors, effects can be added to images that have already been shot (still images only). The functions to create a folder to store recorded images by shooting date or shooting month, and to jump to the first image of each shooting date or to a movie and play have been newly added.

Also, with DIGIC II, higher resolution and high-speed processing were achieved and the startup time and response time were shortened.This camera is equipped with a 12x optical zoom lens, which covers a 35mm film equivalent focal length ranging from 36 mm (Wide Angle) to 432 mm (Telephoto), and has an f/2.7 (Wide Angle) - f/3.5 (Telephoto) aperture. By incorporating a UD (Ultra Low Dispersion) lens into the lens element, the chromatic aberration has been reduced. This model incorporates an image stabilizer, which reduces the effects of camera shake while shooting. In addition, the zoom lens's super-smooth, super-fast ultra sonic motor (USM) provides all the zooming speed you need.This camera can take VGA (640 x 480 pixels) movies with exceptional image quality at a full 30 frames per second. Furthermore, it can shoot movies even in the still image shooting modes and vice versa. Also, a new mode to take very smooth QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) movies at 60 frames per second has been newly added. Moreover, digital zoom and manual focus are available as well as adjusting the zoom or exposure, or locking the AF or exposure while shooting a movie. Movies can be taken continuously (depending on the storage capacity of the recording media) until the clip size reaches 1GB or the clip length reaches 1 hour.The recording pixels include a \"Widescreen\" feature that has the same aspect ratio as 16:9 widescreen TVs for shooting wide images. Adding ISO [800] has resulted in a faster shutter speed even when shooting in dark environments. Also, [High ISO Auto] that has a program diagram with a higher ISO speed setting has been added to the ISO speed position.Featuring \"Sports\" as a shooting mode has resulted in better focusing of moving subjects, which is especially useful when shooting sporting events. A \"My Colors\" mode that changes image colors when shooting has been added to the FUNC. Menu of the PowerShot S3 IS.Macro mode is used to record subjects at close range, and Super Macro is used when the distance from the front of the lens to the subject is in the range of 0 to 10 cm (0 to 3.9 in.).This camera is equipped with an upgraded 2.0-inch Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Information display on the LCD monitor and LCD viewfinder when shooting can be customized. The function (shooting mode: P/Tv/Av/M) to display the histogram when shooting was added and Grid lines can be displayed for easier photo composition. Also, this camera shows the possible shooting range within which auto-focusing at the current zoom position.As the recording quality is set up to 16 bit, 44.100 k Hz with the stereo microphone, high quality recording is possible when shooting movies. In addition, \"Sound Recorder\" can record sound only, without images.Using My Colors, effects can be added to images that have already been shot (still images only). The functions to create a folder to store recorded images by shooting date or shooting month, and to jump to the first image of each shooting date or to a movie and play have been newly added. Transition effects can be applied while transitioning between scenes or on slide shows.A Print/Share button has also been equipped, letting you easily print your images by connecting the camera directly to a direct print compatible printer and then simply pressing this button.

In Shutter Priority, you choose the shutter speed and the camera finds the appropriate aperture. With slow exposure times, Canon's noise reduction system is activated to ensure reduced image noise. Program mode gives you access to advanced exposure compensation features while shooting mostly automatically. In Movie Digest mode, the camera records a video clip prior to capturing a still image and then combines a day's worth of clips into a video. You can easily playback and review clips and delete unwanted scenes. In Sports mode, the camera uses a high shutter speed to capture fast-moving subjects. Portrait mode provides a wide aperture, focusing the subject and blurring the background. Other shooting modes available include Smooth Skin, Smart Shutter for detecting smiles and winks, Handheld Night Scene, Snow, and Fireworks. Stitch Assist lets you create panoramic photos by combining multiple frames. Creative Filters available include Toy Camera, Poster Effect, Monochrome and more. High Dynamic Range combines 3 different exposures into a single evenly-lit image. Plus, you have Fisheye, Miniature Effect for Movies & Stills, Soft Focus, Super Vivid, Color Accent and Color Swap modes.

It features a new, ultra fast f/2.0 aperture 4.x optical zoom lens, along with a 4 Mega Pixel primary color CCD and Canon's unique high-performance DIGIC processor.The PowerShot G3 is equipped with a compact and fast 4x optical zoom lens with a focal length of 7.2 to 28.8mm (35-140mm equivalent in 35mm format) and a fast maximum aperture range of f2.0 (W) to f3.0 (T). Made up of 8 elements in 7 groups, the lens focusing is controlled from the rear by moving just one element. This means that focusing is fast and consumes very little power.RAW mode allows you to obtain original image data, recording the image direct from the CCD without any image processing. With RAW mode images, you can alter and set the parameters of image before being saved or transferred to the PC. A loss-less (reversible) compression method for RAW image capture is used (as opposed to the non-reversible compression formats of JPEG), allowing all the original data to be retrieved from the CompactFlash card. It also has the advantage of requiring approximately 40% less space than a totally uncompressed image, with no loss in quality.3 Exposure Modes include Center weighted average, Evaluative and Spot. Center weighted average measures light from the entire image but weights the metering in favor of the center portion. With the Evaluative mode, the image is divided into a number of blocks and the image is evaluated to determine the subject, brightness, if it is front/back lit and selects the appropriate exposure. Using the Spot mode light is measured from a specific point of the image. The spot metering point can be either fixed to the center or linked to the currently selected focusing point.There is no 'step' drop in resolution as the camera enters the digital zoom function. The optical zoom is used as far as possible, to the limit of the telephoto end (105mm in 35mm format), at which point the digital zoom function will operate, gradually reducing the CCD reading area until it reaches the final center portion.12 EOS-based picture-taking modes include two NEW custom modes, manual, Av, TV, Program, Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Night Scene, Stitch Assist and Movie mode.Since the aperture and shutter mechanisms are now separate devices, the PowerShot G3 can use a greater variety of aperture/shutter combinations than the PowerShot G2, allowing for greater photographic flexibility. The PowerShot G3 can now achieve a shutter speed of 1/1250th sec at max aperture f2.0 - f3.0 (compared to 1/500th sec from the G2). Conversely, to achieve a shutter speed of 1/2000th sec, the maximum aperture is f4.0 - f5.6.Continuous Shooting Modes include High Speed and Normal. Choosing the 'speed priority' mode will allow the camera to shoot a number of shots at a very fast rate, however, this very fast burst rate can only be sustained for a small number of shots. (Approx. 1.5 images/sec for a maximum of 14 images at this speed). Choosing the 'quantity priority' mode will allow the camera to shoot a larger number of shots than in the 'speed priority mode' in quick succession, but is slower. This mode shoots at a similar rate to the PowerShot G1 in continuous shooting mode. (Approx. 2.5 images/sec for a maximum of 14 images at this speed)Interval Shooting are selectable from the menu system (P, Tv, Av, M, C modes). Multiple of 1-minute intervals for up to 60 minutes; maximum of 100 shots (depending on capacity of CF card).The PowerShot G3 allows the user to select the camera's ND filter. When selected, an ND8 (or 0.9) filter is placed over the sensor, internally within the camera, reducing the amount of light reaching the sensor without affecting the color balance. This is especially useful in very bright conditions where a slow shutter speed/large aperture is required or when using a flash in very close, macro photography.A tiny sensor has been incorporated into ...\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCanon ModelG3 MPN8120A013\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom4x Digital Zoom3.6x Sensor Resolution4.0 MP Screen Size1.8\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/1.8\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range5-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutofocus & Fixed Focus & Manual, Automatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera34 - 140mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/2000 sec Min Shutter Speed15 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Evaluative, Spot Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 50 Light Sensitivity Max400\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.7 m - 5 m Camera Flash FeaturesAuto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash +/- Compensation, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryCompactFlash Card Type I, CompactFlash I, CompactFlash II Floppy Drive StorageNone\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeOptical, Optical (Through-the-lens) Optical Viewfinder TypeReal-image zoom Viewfinder - Field Coverage83% Dioptric Correction Range-3 to +1\nDimensions Depth2.5 in.

The optical zoom is used as far as possible, to the limit of the telephoto end (105mm in 35mm format), at which point the digital zoom function will operate, gradually reducing the CCD reading area until it reaches the final center portion.12 EOS-based picture-taking modes include two NEW custom modes, manual, Av, TV, Program, Auto, Portrait, Landscape, Night Scene, Stitch Assist and Movie mode.Since the aperture and shutter mechanisms are now separate devices, the PowerShot G3 can use a greater variety of aperture/shutter combinations than the PowerShot G2, allowing for greater photographic flexibility. The PowerShot G3 can now achieve a shutter speed of 1/1250th sec at max aperture f2.0 - f3.0 (compared to 1/500th sec from the G2). Conversely, to achieve a shutter speed of 1/2000th sec, the maximum aperture is f4.0 - f5.6.Continuous Shooting Modes include High Speed and Normal. Choosing the 'speed priority' mode will allow the camera to shoot a number of shots at a very fast rate, however, this very fast burst rate can only be sustained for a small number of shots. (Approx. 1.5 images/sec for a maximum of 14 images at this speed). Choosing the 'quantity priority' mode will allow the camera to shoot a larger number of shots than in the 'speed priority mode' in quick succession, but is slower. This mode shoots at a similar rate to the PowerShot G1 in continuous shooting mode. (Approx. 2.5 images/sec for a maximum of 14 images at this speed)Interval Shooting are selectable from the menu system (P, Tv, Av, M, C modes). Multiple of 1-minute intervals for up to 60 minutes; maximum of 100 shots (depending on capacity of CF card).The PowerShot G3 allows the user to select the camera's ND filter. When selected, an ND8 (or 0.9) filter is placed over the sensor, internally within the camera, reducing the amount of light reaching the sensor without affecting the color balance. This is especially useful in very bright conditions where a slow shutter speed/large aperture is required or when using a flash in very close, macro photography.A tiny sensor has been incorporated into ...\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCanon ModelG3 MPN8120A013\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom4x Digital Zoom3.6x Sensor Resolution4.0 MP Screen Size1.8\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/1.8\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range5-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutofocus & Fixed Focus & Manual, Automatic, Manual Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera34 - 140mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/2000 sec Min Shutter Speed15 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Evaluative, Spot Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Manual, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 50 Light Sensitivity Max400\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.7 m - 5 m Camera Flash FeaturesAuto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash +/- Compensation, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryCompactFlash Card Type I, CompactFlash I, CompactFlash II Floppy Drive StorageNone\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeOptical, Optical (Through-the-lens) Optical Viewfinder TypeReal-image zoom Viewfinder - Field Coverage83% Dioptric Correction Range-3 to +1\nDimensions Depth2.5 in.
