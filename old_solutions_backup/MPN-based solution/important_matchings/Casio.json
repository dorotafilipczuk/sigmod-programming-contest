Do almost everything right on the LCD - like choosing an AF point, set exposure settings and record videos - all with the touch of one finger. The PowerShot ELPH 500 HS brings the art of photography at your command. The Canon HS SYSTEM takes the frustration out of low light shooting. The system delivers clear, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, and frees you from the sometimes unwanted effects of using the flash. Beautiful low light shots are possible at both low and high ISO speeds, and the dynamic range is expanded to retain maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.Experiencing the brilliance of full HD video in a Canon PowerShot ELPH digital camera has never been easier. With the convenient dedicated movie button, you'll be able to instantly record everyday moments in amazing life-like realism at a push of a button. You can also operate the optical zoom while shooting video so you can get in close - but don't worry about shaky footage because Dynamic IS will help keep your videos steady! The PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera sports an f/2.0 aperture, perfect for creating enticing portraits, by drawing attention to the face and blurring the background with its impressively shallow depth-of-field. The large aperture also does more. It lets you capture more nuances in low light shooting by using more of the available light. The ultra wide-angle lens puts more into every frame so you can easily photograph landscapes, tall buildings and large groups of people.The PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera is equipped with High-Speed Burst mode that lets you catch every single detail in pure Canon brilliance. A 4.4x optical zoom lens enables you to capture subjects that are close and far away. The added bonus of an optical image stabilizer ensures that every moment you photograph will come out amazingly clear and focused. The PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera takes the quality of your still images and videos to a high level automatically. The camera's advanced Smart AUTO system detects a wealth of information about the scene you're shooting, then automatically selects the optimal settings for you. Now with an expanded range of 32 shooting scenarios, the camera handles a wide variety of situations, freeing you up to concentrate on composing your shot and capturing the moment you're looking for.For photography enthusiasts, the ability to control aperture and shutter speed is key. The Aperture- and Shutter-priority modes on the Canon PowerShot ELPH 500 HS digital camera make it easy for anyone to take extra control over the look and feel of images captured. In Aperture-priority mode, you set the aperture and the camera automatically selects an appropriate shutter speed. This lets you create sharp subjects with beautifully blurred backgrounds, and landscapes with foreground, middle ground and background all in focus. Shutter-priority mode lets you choose a shutter speed while the camera automatically selects the aperture. Higher shutter speeds are great for catching stop-action shots of moving subjects, while lower shutter.Putting together a video containing highlights from family vacations, important occasions and other special events is now easier than you might imagine. Using the Movie Digest mode, you can have the camera automatically record a short video clip every time you shoot a still image. The camera will then combine an entire day's worth of clips into a single video. No editing required - Movie Digest mode does all the work, so you can sit back and enjoy your video!\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandCanon ModelELPH 500 HS / IXUS 310 HS MPN5128B001AA\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom4.4x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution12.1 MP Screen Size3.2\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.3\" Sensor TypeCMOS\nLens System Macro Focus Range3-50cm Focus AdjustmentAutomatic Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera24 - 105mm\nExposure Max Shutter Speed1/1600 sec Min Shutter Speed15 sec Exposure compensation\u00c2\u00b12 EV range, in 1/3 EV steps Exposure MeteringCenter-Weighted, Evaluative, Spot Exposure ModesAperture-Priority, Automatic, Program, Shutter-Priority Light SensitivityISO 100, ISO 1600, ISO 200, ISO 3200, ISO 400, ISO 800, ISO auto Light Sensitivity Max3200\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.5 m - 5 m Camera Flash FeaturesAF Illuminator Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Supported Flash MemoryEye-Fi card, MultiMediaCard, MultiMediaCardplus, SD Memory Card, SDHC Memory Card, SDXC Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeNone\nDimensions Depth0.98 in.

A high-resolution megapixel CCD provides 2.0 million effective pixels (2.11 million total pixels) for images that print beautifully. Fixed focus eliminates the need for lens movement, which shortens startup time and shooting time.
