It also has an optical 3x Zoom-Nikkor lens with a focal range of 38-116mm (35mm equivalent) - making it a cinch to capture everything from pleasing portraits to expansive landscapes with true-to-life color and fine detail. Furthermore, the COOLPIX L6 delivers the world's longest battery life - being able to shoot up to an incredible 1000 images when using the supplied Energizer lithium AA-size batteries! Highly convenient, such extended battery life is ideally suited to travel or when capturing important events, such as a wedding, where you can't afford to run out of power.The COOLPIX L6 offers light sensitivity beyond conventional compact digitals, too, with settings up to ISO 800. This means users can shoot pictures in lower light without having to use a long exposure. It also allows users to select higher shutter speeds for the capture of fast-moving subjects. And because the COOLPIX L6 has a large, easy-to-view 115.000-dot 2.5-inch LCD monitor, it supports smooth composition as well as enjoyable image playback anywhere.A choice of 15 Scene modes makes it easy to achieve optimal results in a wide range of common shooting conditions. Simply select the Scene mode most closely corresponding to the scene at hand and the COOLPIX L6 automatically chooses the best settings for pleasing results. Four of these handy Scene modes also feature Scene assist, which helps users to achieve better composition.The COOLPIX L6 also makes it especially easy to get great-looking results in challenging conditions by featuring three unique in-camera Nikon image innovations - Face Priority AF that automatically detects and achieves sharp focus on people's faces wherever they are in the frame, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix that can automatically overcome the red-eye effect sometimes caused by flash, and Nikon's D-Lighting that can rescue underexposed images or shots taken with too much back light.The COOLPIX L6 additionally features approximately 23MB of internal memory, which allows users to go on shooting even without external memory media. It's also compatible with SD cards, which are widely available around the world.

It also has an optical 3x Zoom-Nikkor lens with a focal range of 38-116mm (35mm equivalent) - making it a cinch to capture everything from pleasing portraits to expansive landscapes with true-to-life color and fine detail. Furthermore, the COOLPIX L6 delivers the world's longest battery life - being able to shoot up to an incredible 1000 images when using the supplied Energizer lithium AA-size batteries! Highly convenient, such extended battery life is ideally suited to travel or when capturing important events, such as a wedding, where you can't afford to run out of power.The COOLPIX L6 offers light sensitivity beyond conventional compact digitals, too, with settings up to ISO 800. This means users can shoot pictures in lower light without having to use a long exposure. It also allows users to select higher shutter speeds for the capture of fast-moving subjects. And because the COOLPIX L6 has a large, easy-to-view 115.000-dot 2.5-inch LCD monitor, it supports smooth composition as well as enjoyable image playback anywhere.A choice of 15 Scene modes makes it easy to achieve optimal results in a wide range of common shooting conditions. Simply select the Scene mode most closely corresponding to the scene at hand and the COOLPIX L6 automatically chooses the best settings for pleasing results. Four of these handy Scene modes also feature Scene assist, which helps users to achieve better composition.The COOLPIX L6 also makes it especially easy to get great-looking results in challenging conditions by featuring three unique in-camera Nikon image innovations - Face Priority AF that automatically detects and achieves sharp focus on people's faces wherever they are in the frame, In-Camera Red-Eye Fix that can automatically overcome the red-eye effect sometimes caused by flash, and Nikon's D-Lighting that can rescue underexposed images or shots taken with too much back light.The COOLPIX L6 additionally features approximately 23MB of internal memory, which allows users to go on shooting even without external memory media. It's also compatible with SD cards, which are widely available around the world. What's more, the COOLPIX L6 even adds convenience to printing - allowing users to connect the camera direct to PictBridge-compatible printers to produce beautiful photos without the need for a computer.\nProduct Highlights Video\nProduct Identifiers BrandNikon ModelL6 MPN25551-BUN UPC018208255511\nKey Features Camera TypePoint & Shoot Optical Zoom3x Digital Zoom4x Sensor Resolution6.0 MP Screen Size2.5\"\nOptical Sensor Sensor Size1/2.5\" Sensor TypeCCD\nLens System Macro Focus Range10cm Focus AdjustmentAutofocus & Manual Focus, Automatic Auto Focus typeTTL contrast detection Focal Length Equivalent to 35mm Camera38 - 116mm\nExposure Exposure MeteringMatrix Exposure ModesAutomatic, Program Light Sensitivity Max800\nCamera Flash Flash TypeBuilt-in flash Red Eye ReductionYes Effective Flash Range0.3 m - 5 m Camera Flash FeaturesAuto Flash, Fill-in Flash, Flash Off, Red-eye Reduction Flash, Slow Sync Flash ModesAuto Mode, Fill-in Mode, OFF mode, Red-eye Reduction, Slow Synchro\nMemory / Storage Integrated Memory size23 MB Supported Flash MemoryCompactFlash Card Type I, SD Memory Card\nViewfinder Viewfinder TypeNone, Optical\nDimensions Depth3.3 in.

The EXPEED 3 image-processing engine effortlessly handles the sensor's large data files, while in-camera Picture Control tailors the individual look and feel of your stills and videos. These four assets are vital elements for creating the images you want.\nThanks to the high-speed performance of the EXPEED 3 image-processing engine and an exclusive driving mechanism that drives the mirror independently, the D610 is capable of high-speed continuous shooting at approx. 6 fps in FX format, for up to 100 shots.\nThe D610's optical viewfinder features approx. 100% frame coverage that enables confirmation of the entire large image area of FX format for precise composition. And approx. 0.7x* magnification allows easy viewing of all the visual elements including the viewfinder information display. The frame coverage and magnification are the same as those of the D4 and D3 series, realizing comfortable shooting.\nThe Nikon FX-format CMOS sensor (35.9 x 24.0 mm) with 24.3 effective megapixels delivers stable, high image quality.\nEXPEED 3 image-processing engine, the same as used for the D4 and D800 series, realizes superior high-speed processing performance.\nThe D610's Picture Control system lets you fine-tune sharpening, contrast, saturation, hue, and various adjustments for Monochrome, etc. in both still images and movies according to your preference.\nThe D610's new Qc (quiet continuous) shutter-release mode reduces mirror noise while still offering up to 3 fps*, for maximum discretion.\n*Based on CIPA Guidelines.\nWith seven focus points compatible with f/8, precise focusing is possible even when attaching a 2.0x teleconverter to telephoto lenses with a maximum aperture of f/4.\nScene Recognition System recognizes the subject's situation accurately prior to shooting and enables precise auto control.\nInheriting an array of specifications and functions equivalent to those of the D4 and D800 series, the D610 combines them in a remarkably small and light camera body.\nSD memory card double slots compatible with high-speed SDXC and UHS-I.\nTime-lapse photography lets you shoot automatically at designated intervals and save as a movie to replay slow-moving activity at high speed.\nThe D610's built-in flash incorporates a commander function that supports Advanced Wireless Lighting.\nINSIDE THE PACKAGENikon D610 Digital SLR Camera Body Only Black * For environmental friendly reason, instruction BOOK Manual may or may not be supplied.

It delivers superior image quality - the hallmark of Nikon products - and features advanced ergonomics, which greatly enhance operational ease and comfort. The camera targets primarily users who demand the same degree of creative capability afforded by an SLR, will settle for nothing less than the best digital camera on the market, and will not compromise when it comes to image quality. The COOLPIX 5400 also suits film-camera users who wish to take advantage of the impressive array of accessories available, to further extend their photographic potential. Any user in search of an extremely versatile, high-quality digital still camera will find the COOLPIX 5400 to be an exciting camera loaded with possibilities. Nikon's newly developed 4x Zoom-Nikkor lens, with its professional-quality 5.8-24mm (equivalent to 28-116mm in 35mm [135] camera format) focal range, offers outstanding optical performance thanks to the incorporation of an ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lens element to minimize chromatic aberration, and two ASP (aspherical) lenses for reduced distortion. Combined with the COOLPIX 5400's 5.1 effective megapixels, they virtually ensure remarkably clear, colorful images with excellent contrast. Nikon has equipped the COOLPIX 5400 with the all-new, highly functional Mode dial, which allows users to directly select exposure modes and set various shooting parameters. The Mode dial works in conjunction with the Command dial and the center-click Multi selector to make camera setting a surprisingly simple task - giving users the freedom to focus on capturing the images they want. The camera incorporates four exposure modes: Programmed Auto [P], Shutter-Priority Auto [S], Aperture-Priority Auto [A] and Manual [M] combine to give you the greatest degree of creative control possible. The COOLPIX 5400 also offers [AUTO] mode, in which the camera automatically performs settings and gives users high-quality point-and-shoot capability. And for striking images in practically any situation, the new COOLPIX features 15 versatile [SCENE] Modes - simply select the mode appropriate for the prevailing conditions, and characteristics such as exposure, focus, flash, contrast, sensitivity and white balance are automatically adjusted by the camera. The COOLPIX 5400 features many advanced digital controls - the new AE-BSS (Auto Exposure-Best Shot Selector) mode, Noise Reduction mode, Saturation Control and White Balance Bracketing among them - which are highly valuable in obtaining optimum image quality. Multiple capture modes receive considerable support from the large 64MB buffer memory, which enables the capture of up to 7 full-size (2, 592 x 1, 944-pixel) pictures at 3 frames per second (fps). To help ensure you don't miss those unexpected or fleeting moments, the COOLPIX 5400 incorporates the new 5 shot buffer mode. And the versatility of the camera is further enhanced by handy, innovative features such as movies with audio and the new Time-lapse movie mode, ideal for observational recording. The newest member of the COOLPIX family offers increased visibility even during daylight photography thanks to the new highly transmissible Vari-angle LCD monitor. And the compact, lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloy body has been designed for maximum durability and portability, and affords a secure, comfortable grip for stability during shooting. All essential accessories are supplied with the COOLPIX 5400 - a battery and charger, a CompactFlash Card, an A/V cable, a USB cable and the comprehensive Nikon View software package. The camera is also compatible with a host of optional accessories, including wideangle and telephoto converters and a newly designed fisheye converter. And the COOLPIX 5400's accessory shoe accommodates a number of Nikon's external Speedlights.

And the versatility of the camera is further enhanced by handy, innovative features such as movies with audio and the new Time-lapse movie mode, ideal for observational recording. The newest member of the COOLPIX family offers increased visibility even during daylight photography thanks to the new highly transmissible Vari-angle LCD monitor. And the compact, lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloy body has been designed for maximum durability and portability, and affords a secure, comfortable grip for stability during shooting. All essential accessories are supplied with the COOLPIX 5400 - a battery and charger, a CompactFlash Card, an A/V cable, a USB cable and the comprehensive Nikon View software package. The camera is also compatible with a host of optional accessories, including wideangle and telephoto converters and a newly designed fisheye converter.

It delivers superior image quality - the hallmark of Nikon products - and features advanced ergonomics, which greatly enhance operational ease and comfort. The camera targets primarily users who demand the same degree of creative capability afforded by an SLR, will settle for nothing less than the best digital camera on the market, and will not compromise when it comes to image quality. The COOLPIX 5400 also suits film-camera users who wish to take advantage of the impressive array of accessories available, to further extend their photographic potential. Any user in search of an extremely versatile, high-quality digital still camera will find the COOLPIX 5400 to be an exciting camera loaded with possibilities. Nikon's newly developed 4x Zoom-Nikkor lens, with its professional-quality 5.8-24mm (equivalent to 28-116mm in 35mm [135] camera format) focal range, offers outstanding optical performance thanks to the incorporation of an ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lens element to minimize chromatic aberration, and two ASP (aspherical) lenses for reduced distortion. Combined with the COOLPIX 5400's 5.1 effective megapixels, they virtually ensure remarkably clear, colorful images with excellent contrast. Nikon has equipped the COOLPIX 5400 with the all-new, highly functional Mode dial, which allows users to directly select exposure modes and set various shooting parameters. The Mode dial works in conjunction with the Command dial and the center-click Multi selector to make camera setting a surprisingly simple task - giving users the freedom to focus on capturing the images they want. The camera incorporates four exposure modes: Programmed Auto [P], Shutter-Priority Auto [S], Aperture-Priority Auto [A] and Manual [M] combine to give you the greatest degree of creative control possible. The COOLPIX 5400 also offers [AUTO] mode, in which the camera automatically performs settings and gives users high-quality point-and-shoot capability. And for striking images in practically any situation, the new COOLPIX features 15 versatile [SCENE] Modes - simply select the mode appropriate for the prevailing conditions, and characteristics such as exposure, focus, flash, contrast, sensitivity and white balance are automatically adjusted by the camera. The COOLPIX 5400 features many advanced digital controls - the new AE-BSS (Auto Exposure-Best Shot Selector) mode, Noise Reduction mode, Saturation Control and White Balance Bracketing among them - which are highly valuable in obtaining optimum image quality. Multiple capture modes receive considerable support from the large 64MB buffer memory, which enables the capture of up to 7 full-size (2, 592 x 1, 944-pixel) pictures at 3 frames per second (fps).

To help ensure you don't miss those unexpected or fleeting moments, the COOLPIX 5400 incorporates the new 5 shot buffer mode. And the versatility of the camera is further enhanced by handy, innovative features such as movies with audio and the new Time-lapse movie mode, ideal for observational recording. The newest member of the COOLPIX family offers increased visibility even during daylight photography thanks to the new highly transmissible Vari-angle LCD monitor. And the compact, lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloy body has been designed for maximum durability and portability, and affords a secure, comfortable grip for stability during shooting. All essential accessories are supplied with the COOLPIX 5400 - a battery and charger, a CompactFlash Card, an A/V cable, a USB cable and the comprehensive Nikon View software package. The camera is also compatible with a host of optional accessories, including wideangle and telephoto converters and a newly designed fisheye converter. And the COOLPIX 5400's accessory shoe accommodates a number of Nikon's external Speedlights.

It delivers superior image quality - the hallmark of Nikon products - and features advanced ergonomics, which greatly enhance operational ease and comfort. The camera targets primarily users who demand the same degree of creative capability afforded by an SLR, will settle for nothing less than the best digital camera on the market, and will not compromise when it comes to image quality. The COOLPIX 5400 also suits film-camera users who wish to take advantage of the impressive array of accessories available, to further extend their photographic potential. Any user in search of an extremely versatile, high-quality digital still camera will find the COOLPIX 5400 to be an exciting camera loaded with possibilities. Nikon's newly developed 4x Zoom-Nikkor lens, with its professional-quality 5.8-24mm (equivalent to 28-116mm in 35mm [135] camera format) focal range, offers outstanding optical performance thanks to the incorporation of an ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lens element to minimize chromatic aberration, and two ASP (aspherical) lenses for reduced distortion. Combined with the COOLPIX 5400's 5.1 effective megapixels, they virtually ensure remarkably clear, colorful images with excellent contrast. Nikon has equipped the COOLPIX 5400 with the all-new, highly functional Mode dial, which allows users to directly select exposure modes and set various shooting parameters. The Mode dial works in conjunction with the Command dial and the center-click Multi selector to make camera setting a surprisingly simple task - giving users the freedom to focus on capturing the images they want. The camera incorporates four exposure modes: Programmed Auto [P], Shutter-Priority Auto [S], Aperture-Priority Auto [A] and Manual [M] combine to give you the greatest degree of creative control possible. The COOLPIX 5400 also offers [AUTO] mode, in which the camera automatically performs settings and gives users high-quality point-and-shoot capability. And for striking images in practically any situation, the new COOLPIX features 15 versatile [SCENE] Modes - simply select the mode appropriate for the prevailing conditions, and characteristics such as exposure, focus, flash, contrast, sensitivity and white balance are automatically adjusted by the camera. The COOLPIX 5400 features many advanced digital controls - the new AE-BSS (Auto Exposure-Best Shot Selector) mode, Noise Reduction mode, Saturation Control and White Balance Bracketing among them - which are highly valuable in obtaining optimum image quality.

And for striking images in practically any situation, the new COOLPIX features 15 versatile [SCENE] Modes - simply select the mode appropriate for the prevailing conditions, and characteristics such as exposure, focus, flash, contrast, sensitivity and white balance are automatically adjusted by the camera. The COOLPIX 5400 features many advanced digital controls - the new AE-BSS (Auto Exposure-Best Shot Selector) mode, Noise Reduction mode, Saturation Control and White Balance Bracketing among them - which are highly valuable in obtaining optimum image quality. Multiple capture modes receive considerable support from the large 64MB buffer memory, which enables the capture of up to 7 full-size (2, 592 x 1, 944-pixel) pictures at 3 frames per second (fps). To help ensure you don't miss those unexpected or fleeting moments, the COOLPIX 5400 incorporates the new 5 shot buffer mode. And the versatility of the camera is further enhanced by handy, innovative features such as movies with audio and the new Time-lapse movie mode, ideal for observational recording. The newest member of the COOLPIX family offers increased visibility even during daylight photography thanks to the new highly transmissible Vari-angle LCD monitor. And the compact, lightweight magnesium (Mg) alloy body has been designed for maximum durability and portability, and affords a secure, comfortable grip for stability during shooting. All essential accessories are supplied with the COOLPIX 5400 - a battery and charger, a CompactFlash Card, an A/V cable, a USB cable and the comprehensive Nikon View software package. The camera is also compatible with a host of optional accessories, including wideangle and telephoto converters and a newly designed fisheye converter. And the COOLPIX 5400's accessory shoe accommodates a number of Nikon's external Speedlights.

Photographers can easily take the camera anywhere and use it comfortably for longer periods of time. On top of that, the Df incorporates the same FX-format CMOS sensor and EXPEED 3 image-processing engine as the D4. Expect exceptionally versatile image quality ??from ISO 100 to 12800.\nUsing its large, metallic mechanical dials, photographers will rediscover a more direct connection with their camera. This is Nikon's smallest, lightest FX-format body, yet it delivers the same exceptional image quality as the D4 ??from low to extremely high ISO. The Df represents a fusion between tactile precision mechanics and the exquisite image quality of the flagship camera D4, stimulating artistic sensibilities and inspiring photographers to new levels of creativity beyond previous limitations of time, place and volume of available light. This is Nikon's proposal to passionate photographers: rediscover the fulfillment of measured, deliberate photography, and create your pictures one frame at a time.\nThe large mechanical dials on the top deck are carved from solid metal in order to allow more direct and purposeful exposure control. Photographers have easy access to a diverse array of innovative features, helping them create one-of-a-kind images. That's what the Df is built for: helping photographers relay their ideas more intuitively via mechanical dials, and then using cutting-edge innovations to produce the results they envisioned. With the Df, each frame becomes meaningful again.\nDirect, purposeful camera operation to inspire photographers\nFX format with 16.2-megapixel resolution: for photographers who roam\nDedicated to high-quality still photography\nTactile precision mechanics: one-of-a-kind images, all under your direct control\nIntuitive simplicity: the key to distilling your creativity\nPrecision design: the feel of elite operation\nIntimacy with your subject: glass pentaprism optical viewfinder with approx. 100% frame coverage\nCutting-edge innovation to further support intuitive camera operation\ni button for quick and direct access to various functions\nCompatible with non-AI NIKKOR lenses: exposure meter coupling also available by manual matching of the camera aperture setting to the lens\nAuthentic Nikon SLR design: the most portable of the FX-format D-SLRs\nThe quartet of true potential: NIKKOR, the Nikon FX-format image sensor and the EXPEED 3 image-processing engine of the D4, and Picture Control\nThe power to change your photography: flagship-quality images and ISO range in a more portable size\nPhotographic flexibility: Picture Control System, Active D-Lighting and HDR\nLightweight and ruggedly constructed body with dust-prevention and weather-resistance employing magnesium alloy\nHighly durable and precise shutter mechanisms tested for 150,000 cycles\nAF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G (Special Edition)\nINSIDE THE PACKAGENikon DF Silver DSLR Full Frame Camera Body Only * For environmental friendly reason, instruction BOOK Manual may or may not be supplied.
