The "dataset" directory currently contains only the "matching_cameras.json"
file. To  run the code that converts that file into the submission format, type:

python3 transitive_closure.py

into the terminal. This will produce a file "submission.csv" and save it to the
"output" directory. This "submission.csv" file is what we currently have
submitted.
