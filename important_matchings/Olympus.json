It denotes the rating of a film's sensitivity to light (based on an arithmetical progression). Though digital cameras don't use film, they have adopted the same rating system for describing the sensitivity of the camera's imaging sensor. Digital cameras often include a control for adjusting the ISO speed; some will adjust it automatically depending on the lighting conditions, adjusting it upwards as the available light dims. For exampe, ISO 200 film is twice as fast as ISO 100 film but only half as fast as ISO 400. The scale is identical to ASA (American Standards Association).

These two factors work as a team to control the amount of light that enters the camera. This is measured in fractions on a shutter speed dial which illustrate how long the shutter opens and closes in a set period of time. The term speed refers to how long the lens remains open. For example, a setting of 1/60 on a shutter speed dial means that the shutter opens and closes within one sixtieth of a second. Various shutter speeds can be used to manipulate the final result of the picture. Usually, a faster shutter speed is used to freeze the scene, for motion shots, while a slower speed is used to create more of an unfocused, abstract result.", "width": ["12.1 cm", "4.75 in."], "dorota-id": "cammarkt.com//453"}, {"<page title>": "Olympus PEN E-P1 12.3 MP Micro Four on sale for $262.90", "camera type": "Point-and-Shoot", "deal first added on": "2-February-2012", "ean13": "0050332169784", "last updated": "09-October-2014", "manufacturer": "Olympus", "product name": "Olympus PEN E-P1 12.3 MP Micro Four Thirds Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera (Body Only)", "product number mpn": "Silver Body", "retail price": "$749.99", "upc": "050332169784", "dorota-id": "www.gosale.com//868"}], "227470": [{"<page title>": "Images Captured By Olympus T100 | Olympus T-100 Digital Point and Shoot Camera Reviews -

And the newly designed E-PL2's ergonomic body makes capturing amazing still images and HD video more fun than ever before. The E-PL2 comes with the Movie and Still Compatible (MSC) ED m14-42mm f3.5/5.6 zoom lens. This kit lens has a smooth, silent and quick inner focus mechanism to make it exceptionally fast and nearly silent when recording high-definition movie.The PEN E-PL2's live guide system takes the guesswork out of great photography and videography by allowing you to preview effects at the touch of a button. Want more vivid or muted color in your shot? Want warmer or cooler color? Want a brighter or darker subject, or a sharper or softer background? Simply select live guide and turn the wheel on the back of the camera to slide through numerous photographic and videographic effects. Make adjustments and watch the LCD as the effects are made live - before the image is captured!The E-PL2 provides an overall excellent user experience with a large, easy-to-view 3.0-inch 460,000-dot high-resolution LCD monitor and a control dial. Olympus appreciates that you may not have hours to spend retouching your images on the computer. The E-PL2 has improved art filters with art filter variations that allow users to customize each filter with different moods and effects and an art effect function to add various composition effects to the picture. Six art filters are incorporated including the dramatic tone filter. With the E-PL2's multiple exposure you can shoot one shot, then another and combine them in real time, or capture both shots separately and combine them within the camera later. At the heart of the E-PL2 is a large-size image sensor. This big sensor is inside the much smaller body of the E-PL2. This high-performance 12.3-megapixel live MOS image sensor delivers excellent dynamic range, accurate color fidelity, and state-of-the-art technology to reduce noise and capture fine image details in both highlight and shadow areas.Recording HD movies with the E-PL2 is simple thanks to an easy-to-reach one-touch record button on the back of the camera body. If you're about to snap a photo and you realize a video would capture the spirit of the scene even better, simply press the record button and instantly you're capturing videos! Easily toggle back and forth between capturing stills and video by using your index finger to press the shutter button or your thumb to press the red record button.

And the newly designed E-PL2's ergonomic body makes capturing amazing still images and HD video more fun than ever before. The E-PL2 comes with the Movie and Still Compatible (MSC) ED m14-42mm f3.5/5.6 zoom lens. This kit lens has a smooth, silent and quick inner focus mechanism to make it exceptionally fast and nearly silent when recording high-definition movie.The PEN E-PL2's live guide system takes the guesswork out of great photography and videography by allowing you to preview effects at the touch of a button. Want more vivid or muted color in your shot? Want warmer or cooler color? Want a brighter or darker subject, or a sharper or softer background? Simply select live guide and turn the wheel on the back of the camera to slide through numerous photographic and videographic effects. Make adjustments and watch the LCD as the effects are made live - before the image is captured!The E-PL2 provides an overall excellent user experience with a large, easy-to-view 3.0-inch 460,000-dot high-resolution LCD monitor and a control dial. Olympus appreciates that you may not have hours to spend retouching your images on the computer. The E-PL2 has improved art filters with art filter variations that allow users to customize each filter with different moods and effects and an art effect function to add various composition effects to the picture. Six art filters are incorporated including the dramatic tone filter. With the E-PL2's multiple exposure you can shoot one shot, then another and combine them in real time, or capture both shots separately and combine them within the camera later. At the heart of the E-PL2 is a large-size image sensor. This big sensor is inside the much smaller body of the E-PL2. This high-performance 12.3-megapixel live MOS image sensor delivers excellent dynamic range, accurate color fidelity, and state-of-the-art technology to reduce noise and capture fine image details in both highlight and shadow areas.Recording HD movies with the E-PL2 is simple thanks to an easy-to-reach one-touch record button on the back of the camera body. If you're about to snap a photo and you realize a video would capture the spirit of the scene even better, simply press the record button and instantly you're capturing videos! Easily toggle back and forth between capturing stills and video by using your index finger to press the shutter button or your thumb to press the red record button.
